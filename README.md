# databricks_etl_controlled_medication_sales
This repository contains an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process the SNGPC dataset of sales for controlled and antimicrobial medications.  The project uses Databricks to handle the ingestion and transformation of large-volume files, converting raw historical data into a clean, structured, and ready-for-analysis format.
